## The Problem:
Finding employment trends is necessary for <i>DataSearch</i>, a staffing agency.

## Dataset:
The data is a made-up compilation of crucial facts from the job posting sector (2017-2021). The dataset consists of columns that are both quantitatively and qualitatively characterized.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>In Scope</th>
    <th>Out of Scope</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What does a data scientist make on average?</td>
    <td>How old, on average, are recruiters?</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What does a data scientist make on average?</td>
    <td>How many people typically apply for positions that are not in data science?</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Which analytical abilities are associated with job postings?</td>
    <td> </td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What are the trends in terms of how frequently jobs are posted?</td>
    <td> </td> 
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>True</th>
    <th>False</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The salary offered for a position increases as the number of years of experience increases.</td>
    <td>The most well-liked and in-demand position in data science is data science manager.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The number of job openings has increased over the last five years.</td>
    <td>There is no correlation between the number of years of experience needed for a job and the position level.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The wage information has a lot of empty values.</td>
    <td> </td> 
  </tr>
</table>
